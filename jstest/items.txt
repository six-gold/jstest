On October 6, 2007, a jury found that Isiah Thomas sexually harassed a New York Knicks executive, who was fired when she told Madison Square Garden, the organization that owns the Knicks, that Isiah Thomas sexually harassed her. She was awarded $11.6 million to be paid by MSG and MSG’s owner, James Dolan. Here is another thing that actually, inarguably happened. On May 5, 2015, MSG named Isiah Thomas the president of the New York Liberty, a basketball team also owned by MSG who compete in the Women’s National Basketball Association. That same day, when people objected to a sexual harasser being put in charge of a women’s basketball team, MSG released a statement saying, among other things, “We did not believe the allegations then, and we don’t believe them now.” Here is one final thing that actually, inarguably happened. Isiah Thomas went on ESPN’s Mike and Mike show today, and was posed with the question: “How should fans of the New York Liberty reconcile your position with that team and the sexual harassment history of you back in your days with the Knicks?”  Advertisement    “When the jury had an opportunity to fine,” Thomas began. “They fined Madison Square Garden. I was not liable or personally held for anything. The jury found no findings.” “Anyone who’s vetted this,” he went on, “has looked at it, has come out and found that—as the jury found—that there were no findings in terms of Isiah Thomas.” Here is a thing that actually, inarguably happened.

I don't want to use sixaxis app if I don't have to.    - install "ITB"-Version to get rid off the on-screen buttons (invisible touch buttons) - Sixaxis won't work without root but won't help you with your Ipega anyway - Ipega - like many other controllers - should work partially but with mapping-problems I guess. There's nothing you can do at the moment - maybe get a DS4 ...

I can stream flawlessly on my local network, but as soon as I try it from another network, it fails to connect and spits out random errors. I've got a static address setup for my PS4 and I have UDP 9304 forwarded to it on my router. This Remote Streaming used to work perfectly. Anyone have any ideas on how to get it sorted out?

Hey, I also just got a new ipega 9023 controller, I have a galaxy s6 and sixaxis and dualshock controllers do not work because i am on lollipop and the sixaxis app gets a segmentation fault every time... i noticed that the mappings for l2 and r2 do not work and neither does the dpad or the RIGHT ANALOG STICK! but everything else is 100% fine on the ipega 9023 controller. all buttons but the dpad and l2 and r2 +right anolog work flawlessly, is there a way you can add support for the mappings in a new version please? Im sure others will find this veryyyy useful as well. The mappings needed for ipega to work are  DPAD CONTROLS: (UP) pad1. Y HAT-, (DOWN) pad1. Y HAT+, (RIGHT) pad1. X HAT-, (LEFT) pad1. X HAT+,(R2) pad1.r2, (L2)pad1.l2, For the right analog stick it is as follows: (UP) pad1.Z Rotation- ; (DOWN) pad1.Z Rotation+ ; (LEFT) pad1.Z Axis- ; (RIGHT) pad1.Z Axis+ ;  these are the mappings that need support, i do not know if there is a way i can just change thhe mappings myself but any help is greatly appreciated.

Port existing cell number to Google Fi account (call it account1).  2. Set up my Google GV account (account2) to "Ring Hangouts for incoming phone calls."  3. Associate both account1 and account2 with my Nexus 6. This would only allow you to get GV phone calls if you have a data connection, but that's probably OK. That might work.

How many Nexus users are even aware of project if?    Honestly, I would say a good percentage are aware of it, as the nexus program is not so mucha consumer device as it is a developer/enthusiast device. Granted the nexus 5/6 is more consumer then the older ones, but still I would say a larger percent of nexus owners follow this stuff compared to say samsung galaxy purchasers.

To those saying "Why would I use WiFi instead of wireless"...are you kidding? Wireless N (which is old technology) tops out at 300Mbps, which is 30x faster than the average T-Mobile LTE speed (which is currently the highest average among domestic carriers). Change to Wireless AC and you now have a top speed of around 7Gbps (8x866Mbps).    Good luck getting your home Internet to go 300 Mbps or even 7Gbps. Unless you live in an extremely popular city.

You could buy a 1 GB plan (at $30.00 a month) and if you go over a little, like my example above; you're only paying $33.00 (plus taxes of course) vs. paying $40.00 on a regular carrier. If you don't use a lot of that 1 GB of data, you get credited what you don't use.  It all bolls down to what you want to pay up front initially and what you think you will use. I will probably start with a 4 GB plan since I've never used that much data, but have gone over 3 GB once.

Using your example, let's say you have a 1GB plan but you use 1.3 GB. The cost will be $33.00 (plus taxes). But let's say you have a 2GB plan and you use the same amount of data, 1.3GB. Your cost for the month is $40 with the $7 credited back to you on the next bill. Correct? Same exact cost, $33, except in the 1GB plan you are not giving them $40 and having $7 tied up with credits. If that's correct, my original question still stands.. why would anyone sign up for something other than the 1GB plan? There doesn't seem to be any advantage to picking one the higher plans         Reply      Read More       Post Reply  Subscribe to Thread  Page 25 of 35  First  15 23 24 25 26 27  Last        Previous Thread   Next Thread         Thread Tools    Show Printable Version    Email this Page          Display Modes    Linear Mode    Switch to Hybrid Mode    Switch to Threaded Mode          Search this Thread            Advanced Search                          Top Threads in Nexus 6 General by ThreadRank      Xposed Issues on Nexus 6?

Despite concerns from some residents, scientists say two recent earthquakes centered in the Baldwin Hills area — including one Sunday morning — do not appear to be connected to drilling operations at nearby oil fields. ( Zahira Torres and Laura J. Nelson ) Even the three quakes in Riverside County were too far apart to all be linked. The first two, a magnitude-3.7 and -2.7 that struck shortly after midnight, both were traced back to the San Jacinto fault zone. But the third temblor, a magnitude-3.1 near Corona at 9:11 a.m., occurred in a different fault zone.Scientists are still studying the details of the third earthquake, which occurred near the Elsinore and Whittier faults, Caltech seismologist Jennifer Andrews said.As for the first two, it seemed like business as usual for the San Jacinto fault zone, a major network of faults in Southern California."We see relatively small earthquakes [on the San Jacinto fault], but it's relatively active," Andrews said.  cComments    God is punishing California, and America for obvious reasons. warriornation69 at 10:20 AM May 12, 2015    Add a comment See all comments     18     Hundreds of miles north, in California’s East Bay area, three small earthquakes shook the Concord area Wednesday morning.The first temblor, a magnitude-3.0, occurred at 7:01 a.m. Half an hour later, a magnitude-3.5 quake and a magnitude-2.6 quake hit within three minutes of each other, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.The three quakes were centered about two miles from Pleasant Hill, four miles from Walnut Creek and 51 miles from Sacramento.Farther up the state, a 3.3-magnitude earthquake struck the Redding area at 11:30 a.m. The epicenter was about five miles from Shasta Lake and 149 miles from Sacramento, according to the USGS.

Apple's Next Big Thing: Your DNA?    By  Stephanie Mlot   May 6, 2015 10:32am EST 2 Comments    The tech giant may collaborate with U.S. researchers to launch apps that let iPhone users have their DNA tested.    961shares                                        There's nowhere Apple won't goâincluding inside the human bodyâto further technology. A new report from the MIT Technology Review suggests the tech giant is working with U.S. researchers on apps that would let iPhone users have their DNA tested. With the help of Cupertino's new ResearchKit platform, which lets doctors and scientists gather data via smartphone apps, Apple devices could be used to gather genetic information. Apple won't be directly collecting or testing genetic code; that will be left up to its academic partners. But data will be preserved in the cloud (presumably iCloud), and MIT reported that certain findings may even appear directly on a consumer's iPhone screen. Apple did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. Citing an anonymous person "with knowledge of the plans," MIT said the company's eventual aim is to "enable the individual to show and share" DNA information with peopleâdoctors, scientists, researchers, even friends and family. Just imagine: Instead of vacation-photo slideshows, you can gather around a smartphone to see images of your relatives' deoxyribonucleic acid, set to music. Attendees at next month's Worldwide Developer's Conference in San Francisco should keep an eye out for more details about Apple's plans for two initial DNA studies. In March, Cupertino unveiled ResearchKit, to let health and fitness apps communicate with each other, with your permission. Within days, thousands of iPhone owners signed up for medical research studies. The software can access data like weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, and asthma inhaler use from the iOS Health app. It can also request other information, like access to the iPhones accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope, and GPS sensors.   //Related Articles        Can These 7 Robots Replace Your Doctor?     Five early ResearchKit apps cover studies for asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. And now, perhaps, DNA, though Apple is not the first to tackle the genetic universe. In 2013, Google announced Calicoâan effort to tackle aging and death by unlocking the body's genetic code. Similarly, IBM's Watson supercomputer was put to use providing insights based on users' genes. BlackBerry hopped on the bandwagon late last year, partnering with NantHealth to give doctors simplified access to genetic data via a secure browser for the BlackBerry Passport.

William Jacobson at Legal Insurrection has a good analysis of how an “unprecedented all-student referendum” on a proposed “full academic and cultural boycott of Israel” ended up backfiring on Students for Justice in Palestine at the elite liberal arts college. SJP actually got more people to sign its petition for the referendum than it got to vote for the referendum itself: In favor: 228 votes, 14% Opposed: 1,144 votes, 71% Abstaining: 247 votes, 15% Total Votes: 1,619 votes, 85% of the student body It was a victory for outgoing President Barry Mills, who wrote in a statement that while the school never would have gone through with a boycott, “it is gratifying to see this resounding and unambiguous statement by our students who clearly understand the vital importance of open discourse between scholars and educational institutions and the free exchange of ideas and knowledge.” Jacobson says SJP had massive momentum going in: This was close to a perfect storm in favor of SJP. It had a core group of seniors who for years have been advocating against Israel on campus. It was operating on a highly progressive campus, and was very organized in its approach. It obviously had interaction with and learned from two of the most vicious anti-Israel groups — Jewish Voice for Peace and American Friends Service Committee. SJP knew to put its Jewish members out front to lead the boycott drive, something we have seen at other campuses. Plus, it was the end of the semester when SJP must have assumed there would be low turnout as students entered reading period and finals. All in all, this was a best case scenario for the anti-Israel, anti-Academic Freedom movement on campus. And it failed miserably. I understand from people involved that once students really found out how damaging the academic boycott would be to academic freedom, the reaction was overwhelmingly negative. This demonstrates what I have said for years — it is through false and misleading propaganda, often by faculty, that BDS has gained a foothold in academia.  At Bowdoin, even a years-long campaign to demonize and dehumanize Israel could not overcome the good sense of the student body who understood that destroying academic freedom for everyone is not the answer to any problem. The vote for plain divestment from Israel was closer at the semi-annual meeting of the General Assembly of the Student Senate of California Community Colleges this weekend, but divestment supporters still lost decisively, 25-44, with six abstentions, pro-Israel student group StandWithUs said:  The California Community College system is the largest educational system in the United States, and is now the largest one in the world to reject a [boycott, divestment and sanctions] proposal. The students of California Community Colleges, through their duly elected representatives, have taken a stand for co-existence and peace – ensuring their voices will not be exploited for an unjust cause.    Read the Legal Insurrection post and the StandWithUs post.

Pero sucedió. Ahora, José Caballero, de 40 años, y Elissa Álvarez, de 20, están "devastados" mientras esperan conocer la condena.Según sentenció la corte del condado de Manatee, Caballero y Álvarez tuvieron sexo en la Playa Cortez, en Bradenton, al sur de Tampa, ante la presencia de varias familias, incluida una chica de 3 años el pasado 20 de julio, conclusión a la que llegaron a partir de las declaraciones de testigos y un video.La pareja, además de enfrentar la pena que se conocerá en los próximos días, ahora tendrá que inscribirse en el registro de delincuentes sexuales.Anthony Dafonseca, subprocurador del estado de Florida, señaló que la fiscalía pedirá una condena de prisión para ambos, pero que la de Álvarez será más leve ya que ella no tiene un historial criminal previo, mientras que su pareja estuvo ocho años encarcelado, cumpliendo una condena por tráfico de cocaína."Le presentamos una oferta razonable, lo que pensábamos que era razonable y ellos decidieron no aceptar responsabilidad por sus actos. A pesar del video, a pesar de los testigos", dijo Dafonseca, quien cuestionó la actitud y defendió que debe ser castigada. "Si analizan que eran las 14.30, en una playa concurrida, sólo un cierto tipo de persona hace eso en frente a niños", expresó.En el mismo sentido, subrayó que quieren poner un castigo ejemplar para evitar casos similares. "Estamos hablando básicamente de turistas, que vienen de Brandon y Riverview y West Virginia, a visitar las playas del Condado Manatee, nuestras playas públicas", dijo Dafonseca, referiéndose a los testigos. "De modo que uno quiere cerciorarse de que algo semejante no ocurra", reafirmó."Estaba bailando"Por su parte, el abogado de la pareja, Ronald Kurpiers, dijo que sus clientes estaban "devastados" por el veredicto.Según reprodujo el diario El Nuevo Herald, Kurpiers afirmó ante la corte que la pareja no estaba teniendo relaciones sexuales, sino que Alvarez estaba bailando encima de Caballero o "animándolo" para que se despertara."Ella no estaba bailando", contestó Dafonseca durante los argumentos finales. "Es un insulto a la inteligencia decir que ella estaba bailando sobre él", agregó.Por su parte, Kurpiers contestó que ni los testigos vieron ni el video muestra una penetración, por lo que las acusaciones son "especulaciones". "No pueden especular. Y para decir que realizaban el coito, tendrían que especular", dijo el letrado.Las familias de los acusados también salieron a defenderlos. "Él es una gran persona", dijo la madre de Caballero. "Hay cosas por las cuales debemos preocuparnos y todavía andan sueltos, gente que han hecho cosas peores", expresó.Por su parte, el padre de Álvarez, dijo que su hija y su pareja de 40 años "se enamoraron y cometieron muchos errores"..lanacion.com | El MundoCOMPARTIRComentá0 Facebook-Twitter-         últimas notas de El Mundohttp://www.lanacion.com.arEl MundoHOY10 JUL Demoledoras críticas del Papa al sistema económico mundialDijo que llegó la hora del cambio y advirtió sobre los “nuevos colonialismos”http://www.lanacion.com.arEl MundoHOY10 JUL Más que un discurso, una encíclica abreviadahttp://www.lanacion.com.arEl MundoHOY10 JUL Sorpresa y críticas por la "cruz comunista"http://www.lanacion.com.arEl MundoHOY10 JUL Un papa propenso a abrazar las raíces del populismo latinoamericanohttp://www.lanacion.com.arEl MundoHOY10 JUL Los bolivianos desplegaron su fervor y también reclamos políticosEn la misa, las consignas contra el gobierno rivalizaron con las proclamas religiosasREDES SOCIALESSeguinos en TwitterTodos los canales Suscribite al alerta de noticias de último momento por mail.Suscribite ahoraVer más suscripciones LO MÁS VISTO DE EL MUNDOEl papa Francisco al recibir el polémico regalo de Evo Morales: `Eso no está bien`EE.UU.: con quimioterapia, destrozó la vida de cientos de pacientes que no tenían cáncerCómo es vivir en 5 de las ciudades más seguras del mundoLos Simpson se burlan de los tropiezos de Donald TrumpPapa Francisco: `Pido perdón por los crímenes contra los pueblos originarios durante la conquista de América`Nube de NoticiasIr a la nube de noticias   TEMAS DE HOYElecciones 2015El papa Francisco en SudaméricaActividad económicaCrisis en Grecia               Desde la web          Comienza en el Vaticano el histórico juicio contra el ex nuncio…             Bitrix24 herramienta web para crear una intranet personal   (Release Geek)           Las crudas imágenes que muestran la devastación del planeta por el…             Comparte archivos y getiona tus proyectos con Bitrix24   (Carlos Leopoldo)           Martín Lousteau denunció que Pro tiene "una doble faz" y que busca…                Comienza en el Vaticano el histórico juicio contra el ex nuncio…             Bitrix24 herramienta web para crear una intranet personal   (Release Geek)           Las crudas imágenes que muestran la devastación del planeta por el…             Comparte archivos y getiona tus proyectos con Bitrix24   (Carlos Leopoldo)           Martín Lousteau denunció que Pro tiene "una doble faz" y que busca…            recomendado por   Los comentarios publicados son de exclusiva responsabilidad de sus autores y las consecuencias derivadas de ellos pueden ser pasibles de sanciones legales.

La transexualidad ha estado presente desde que existe el ser humano, y el término se usa desde 1940, de acuerdo con la Sociedad Española de Endocrinología y Nutrición, pero cada vez es más común observar dentro de la cultura popular a estas personas que con orgullo aceptan haber tomado las medidas necesarias para no vivir más dentro de un cuerpo ajeno. El modelaje es uno de los escenarios en los que se ha apreciado con más fuerza, debido quizá a que las reglas de belleza en ese ámbito permiten un look andrógino, facciones duras, figuras espigadas, piernas largas y estaturas altas. Hoy en día las modelos transexuales se han abierto más posibilidades en el mundo en el que la apariencia es lo que más importa, y así han roto paradigmas no sólo para el modelaje sino dentro de la sociedad en la que estamos inmersos.

Initially she lost 19 pounds in the first 3 weeks. We quit drinking pop (well we allow ourselves one a week as treat), quit all the junk food, and lately she's been staying under her goal of 1200 cals a day. Unfortunately she's having some issue right now with dizziness so she isn't able to workout for the time being.  The last two weeks she's barely lost anything and she's starting to get depressed and discouraged by it. Anything else she should be doing? She drinks plenty of water every day and this is what her daily meals normally consist of.  Breakfast - Green smoothie - 1 Banana, 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/2 cup blueberries, 1 tablespoon of PB2, 1 cup of Kale, 1/3 cup of 1% cottage cheese, and 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk.  Lunch - 100 cal yoplait greek yogurt, orange or banana, or any leftovers from previous day  Dinner - We normally have a main course of lean meat (chicken breast, lean hamburger, ground turkey, etc.) with some type of veggies (normally baked potatoes, corn, green beans, etc.)  Any tips or recommendations for her would be greatly appreciated!

Most people, especially active, require more than 1200 calories. It would also appear that there is almost no protein in the diet, which could be an indication of a deficiency.  Does she have a user name on here? Do you both log calories? Do you both use a food scale?

I go on a diet and my husband loses weight, LOL!  Nineteen pounds is a lot! Her body is normalising after that big loss and she will start losing again once she gets things sorted. Now it is a game of persistence. She likely needs more calories, as counter-intuitive as this sounds.

She's had the dizziness problems off and on even before we started this diet. I try to tell her to eat more, but she's on these "fitstick" things and they recommended 1200 calories.  We just purchased a digital food scale and have slowly started to weigh our food before cooking and when we're planning our daily meals.  I'll try to get her to eat more, but I'm not sure what good that'll do. How much protein should she be taking in everyday? I could start adding some protein powder to our smoothies in the morning.

It warms my heart to hear this. I'm also doing 1200 calories per day, as I am only 5'3. The only time I got dizzy is when I tried to do the atkins diet. I think it made my blood sugar too low or something. Anyways, tell her to focus on eating more protein and fats, but not to go too low on carbs, IMO. That's from my experience. Tell her good luck, and with a motivator like you, she will be just fine.    May 6, 2015 5:22PM  0 ·             blb85  Posts: 149Member Member    Posts: 149Member Member         Typical sustainable weightloss is about 1-2 lbs a week. She probably lost a lot of the water weight in the beginning and is now finally stabling out. Losing weight isn't always a linear progression either. Our bodies sometimes retain more salt/water and lose it just as quickly.  And it's great that she wants to get more healthy! The biggest thing is to remember that this is not a quick fix solution, but a healthy lifestyle to maintain lifelong. So its about learning about what you need to eat to be healthy, not cutting out all foods just to lose a ton of weight very fast. I recommend doing some research into nutrition or even talking to her doctor. With dinner, I would try adding in a whole grain option (for the fiber) like 1/2 c brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat pasta, or even 1 slice whole wheat bread. For lunch, incorporate some granola into the yogurt. Meals should typically be about 300-500 calories a meal, especially if she is only eating 3 meals a day. Snacks can be anywhere up to 200 calories. Suggest switching her yogurt to a snack and her eating a healthy salad full of leafy greens, protein (like chicken), lite dressing; or even a whole grain sandwich/wrap with lean turkey or chicken with greens, avocado, etc.  I'm fearful that her biggest issue with her dizziness is she is not getting all the nutrition she needs from carbs, fats, and protein. There is a minimum amount that everybody needs on a daily basis.

But her ticker says she needs to lose 81 lbs. Definitely need to reassess her calories. Since she doesn't want to, then dizzy she will stay until her health declines so much a doctor gets involved. At 81lbs overweight, her TDEE is much higher than what the intake is and yes dizzy, tired, etc. is from lack of nutrition. Good luck.

My dizzy spells come from lack of hydration and low blood pressure...90/60 typically...might want to get that checked...  Protein is typically 0.8 grams per lb of bw or 1gram for each pound of lean body mass.  Depending on her stats she should probably be eating more...I at 5 ft 7 eat 1800 to lose 1/2lb a week.

Well, for starters, she won't pass out, so that's a bonus.  Seriously, I think you both need some realistic expectations. She lost a bunch in 3 weeks. Her loss wasn't going to continue at that pace.

At 81lbs overweight, her TDEE is much higher than what the intake is and yes dizzy, tired, etc. is from lack of nutrition. Good luck.    Have you two used a calculator to figure out what the TDEE (total daily energy expenditure, in case you haven't heard this term before) for each of you is? I like this one:  http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/  Just pick your activity modifier and a realistic deficit. Custom set this as a goal in MFP instead of using a generic 1200 calorie goal. I like this method because it gives me the same amount to eat each day. You just have to be sure to keep your activity up to what you entered into the equation.  Plus, especially for a woman, there are going to be times of the month when she doesn't lose or even gains some weight. Weight loss doesn't happen steadily, so tell her congrats on 19 lbs lost and just keep the faith.

And then we can either get her or both of you on a more solid plan to success. Weight loss isn't about eliminating a ton of foods based on a perception of "healthier" or better but rather you need to find a balance of nutrient dense foods and treats.   For me, if i don't have at least 180g of carbs a day, i get dizzy. It's probably because I have a naturally low blood sugar level. IIRC, my A1C is 4.0. In fact, my last doctors visit, it was recommended I carb up more often.

More than 75g of carbs a day and my blood sugar skyrockets. I love how we are all unique.  For the OP, I have 90 pounds to lose, 5' 9". I eat 1725 calories a day and lose about 2-3 pounds a week on average, without cardio. It sounds like she could also be low on any number of minerals, like potassium, sodium or magnesium. Maybe switch to a greek style yogurt for lunch.     May 6, 2015 6:40PM  0 ·             JillianRN527  Posts: 81Member Member    Posts: 81Member Member         Eat more. CICO. Also two bananas in a day is a lot of sugar along with the yogurt. If I stay within my calorie range but go over on carbs I don't lose a thing.

I spoke with my wife and she has agreed to at least up her daily calories to 1400 and I also mentioned that she should try to eat back any calories she burns from working out. I also told her to open privacy on her MFP diary in case anyone would like to view her food journal.

We're both still in the process of learning what our bodies need and gaining knowledge so we can make this a lifestyle change instead of it just being another "diet".

Kale is thyroid suppressive (by all means look this up to verify). That'll shut down your weight loss and make you feel like crap for sure. Spinach won't mess with you like that.

Unless there is an underlying medical condition, the majority of folks here on MFP have high success. Best of luck to you both.

That or she is cheating. 1200 calories will make your brain rationalize eating just about anything. Take baby steps eat more food and slowly taper down.

Moreover, google octane benchmark used to crash halfway through in 5.0.1 due to running out of memory, but now it doesn't.

Here's precisely what I did:   - Grabbed the LRX22L factory image (https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aos...y-62276615.tgz), unpacked everything.  - Grabbed the OTA zip (https://android.clients.google.com/p...C.61f6bdb8.zip), just to look inside to see which partitions are actually patched (boot, system, vendor).  - Since I wanted to keep my device unencrypted for performance reasons, I've changed the kernel's ramdisk mount options accordingly (unpacked boot.img, decompressed ramdisk, replaced "forceencrypt" with "encryptable" in fstab, repacked everything). See the modified boot.img attached to this post.  - Booted into bootloader  - Flashed system (fastboot flash system image-volantis-lrx22l/system.img)  - Flashed vendor (fastboot flash vendor image-volantis-lrx22l/vendor.img)  - Flashed kernel (fastboot flash boot boot-lrx22l-encryptable.img)  - Rebooted directly (important!) to recovery (entered HBOOT menu of bootloader and selected reboot recovery)  - In TWRP recovery I wiped cache and dalvik-cache (if you don't wipe caches before the first boot, you system will likely bootloop) and flashed SuperSU  - Rebooted system  As I said, this worked just fine for me. Still, use at your own risk.    How did you flash SuperSu. It keeps saying failed. Do I go through the whole rooting process again? I assume yes...
